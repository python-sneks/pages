#### The Types

At this point, we've learned about 7 different types.
The 5 primitive types are Integer, Float, Boolean, String, and None.
The 2 composite types we've seen so far are Lists and Dictionaries.
These 2 new composite types are special because they are composed of other types.

* Primitive Types: Integer, Float, Boolean, String, None
* Composite Types: List, Dictionary


#### More Types!

There are actually many more composite types in Python.
In fact, there are even ways to create entirely new primitive and composite types.
But for now, we'll stick to these basic 7 types.

> The previous lists are shown, with three new entries under Composite Types: Tuple, Sets, and Classes.

#### Types in Types

With lists, we learned that composite types had element types.
For example, you could have a List of Integers.
Dictionaries have multiple element types, one for each key and one for each value. 
For example, you could have a dictionary that maps String Keys to Float values.

```python
# List of integers
prices = [40, 60, 50]

# Dictionary of Strings to Floats
book_prices = {"Harry Potter": 4.50,
               "War & Peace": 8.75,
               "Good Omens": 12.50}
```

#### Nesting Types

You can also use composite types as element types.
In other words, you can have lists of dictionaries or dictionaries of lists or even lists of lists.
There are no practical limits to how many times you can nest composite types.

> A long complex nested type is shown to demonstrate how there is no limit to the number of levels of nesting.

* List of
 * List of
   * Dictionary mapping
     * Strings to
     * List of
       * Dictionary mapping
         * Integers to
         * ...


#### Nesting Literals
Let us look at a concrete example.
Shown here is a list of dictionaries.
Each dictionary is being used as a Record with the same keys; these dictionaries can therefore represent a bunch of animals.
The element type of the list is dictionary.
The keys of those dictionaries are all strings, and the values are either strings or integers.

```python
Dog = {"Name": str, "Age": int, "Big?": bool}

[
 {"Name": "Klaus",  "Age": 17, "Big?": True},
 {"Name": "Tigger", "Age": 12, "Big?": True},
 {"Name": "Wrex",   "Age": 2,  "Big?": False}
]
```

#### A Representative Element

To quickly understand the structure of a complex nested structure, we find it useful to model the memory.
In the diagram below, we see that we have a list of dictionaries, where the named keys map to different types.

> The same code is shown as before, along with a diagram of boxes and arrows.  
> A box labeled "List of" is pointing towards a box with three keys ("Name", "Age", and "Big?"), each of which has arrows pointing to boxes labeled "String", "Integer", and "Boolean" respectively.

#### Processing Nested Data

As you process this complex nested data's structure, you have to stay aware of where you are.
This is similar to needing to navigate a maze.
Consider a list of dictionaries like the one shown before.
If we wanted to print the name of each animal, we would first need to process them a list using a For loop.
Then, we can process an individual dictionary.

```python
animals = [
 {"Name": "Klaus",  "Age": 17, "Big?": True},
 {"Name": "Tigger", "Age": 12, "Big?": True},
 {"Name": "Wrex",   "Age": 2,  "Big?": False}
]

# Process animals as a list
for animal in animals:
    # process animal as an individual dictionary
	print(animal["Name"])
```

#### Nested Dictionaries

Here we see a dictionary that is composed of dictionaries.
When we access these nested dictionaries, we use square brackets chained together.
The expressions on the right access various elements of the dictionary.
Nesting dictionaries is an excellent way to cluster information.

```python
event = {
    "Name": "Solar Eclipse Party",
    "Attendees": 403,
    "Date": {
        # Nested inner dictionary
        "Month": "April",
        "Day": 8,
        "Year": 2024
    }
}

# Chained dictionary access
event["Date"]["Month"]
```

#### Layers of Nesting

As previously mentioned, there are no limits to how much nesting can happen.
Here we see a list of dictionaries of dictionaries, to represent an event calendar.
Instead of processing this list with a for loop, we can chain list indexing and dictionary access to lookup specific elements.
As our nested structures grow more complex, it becomes more and more important to understand the nature of the data to learn to navigate it.

```python
>>> events = [
    { "Name": "Python Class",
      "Date": {
        "Day": "Thursday",
        "Start": 9,
        "End": 11}},
    { "Name": "Dinner Date",
      "Date": {
        "Day": "Friday",
        "Start": 6,
        "End": 8}},
    { "Name": "Doctor Appointment",
      "Date": {
        "Day": "Monday",
        "Start": 11,
        "End": 12
      }}
]

>>> events[2]["Name"]
'Doctor Appointment'

>>> events[0]["Date"]
{'Day': 'Thursday', 'End': 11, 'Start': 9}

>>> events[1]["Date"]["Start"]
6


```
