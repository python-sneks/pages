The cat in the hat came back the other day, chasing a bat and a rat.
I asked the cat in the hat why the bat and the rat were his combat.
He said, "that bat and the rat said I was fat!"
The bat and the rat groaned and turned to me.
"We said he was phat!" they said as a plea.
I calmed and spoke kindly to the cat with the hat,
"Can't we make this into a nice chat?"
And that was the end of that.
