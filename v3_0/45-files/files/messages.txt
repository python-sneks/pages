Day 1: I have started observation of James Bond.
Day 3: James Bond has still not realized that I am hiding under his fridge.
Day 14: I accidentally sneezed, and James Bond nearly noticed. Close call!
Day 20: After nearly three weeks, James Bond has still not noticed I am not a fridge.
Day 21: Without anyone else to talk to, I am concerned that I might be empathizing with the fridge.
Day 25: I am now the fridge.
Day 27: James Bond hasn't bought any new milk lately. James Bond needs more calcium. I am concerned for him.
Day 29: James Bond discovered me after I offered to help him find the eggs! I had to flee. Ending mission.
