#### Executing a Program

Once a program is written, it can be executed.
This means that the computer will read the text of the program line by line, and perform each step.

#### Terminology

We say that a program is "Run" or "Executed".

> A list of the terminology, showing the words "Run" and "Executed".  
> An annotation on the word "Executed" reads: "Although it may sound like a synonym, to "kill" a program means to end it (the opposite of "executing" it!)"

#### Python

Python is two things: First, as a programming language it is a set of rules for writing Python programs. Second, it is a program that can execute programs written in the Python programming language.

> On the right, an icon for Python source code is shown being transformed into an icon for a Python executable file via an arrow.

#### Programming Environments

Technically, you can write programs in a text editor and then run them with Python separately.
However, most programmers use a Programming Environment that makes it very easy to write programs and then press a single button to run them.

#### Programs are Text

When you write a Python program, you are really just writing some text.
That text needs to be valid Python text, following all of it syntax rules.
But that means its not that different from an essay you might write in english.

> On the right, an essay on the Natural History of Corallines, whatever that is.
